# Morse Code Research.
What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method of encoding textual information using sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`). Each letter of the alphabet and each numeral is assigned a unique combination of dots and dashes. It is primarily used in telecommunication to send messages via audible, visual, or electronic signals.
Morse code is a  method of communication that has stood the test of time, despite the advent of newer technologies. 
Morse code can be transmitted using a variety of means, such as light signals, radio waves, or even sounds.
The speed at which Morse code is transmitted is typically measured in words per minute (WPM), and skilled operators can transmit messages at speeds of up to 60 WPM or more.

Morse code can be transmitted in various ways:
- Audibly (via beeps or tones)
- Visually (using light flashes or flag signals)
- Electronically (such as with telegraphs)
It is particularly useful in situations where voice communication is not possible or reliable.
## Historical Context
Morse code was invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s and 1840s. It was initially designed to be used with the electric telegraph, one of the earliest forms of long-distance communication. 
Some key milestones in the history of Morse code:
- 1844: The first telegraph message, “What hath God wrought,” was sent using Morse code.
- Late 1800s to early 1900s: Morse code was widely adopted for maritime communication.
- World Wars: Morse code played a critical role during both World War I and World War II, especially in naval operations and encrypted messaging.
- 1999: The International Maritime Organization officially ended Morse code’s use for distress signaling.
Despite technological advancements, Morse code remains in use today by amateur radio enthusiasts and in emergency situations.

## How Morse Code Works
Morse code represents characters using:
- **Dots** (`.`): Short signals
- **Dashes** (`-`): Long signals

### Timing:
- A dot lasts for 1 time unit
- A dash lasts for 3 time units
- The space between parts of the same letter is 1 unit
- The space between letters is 3 units
- The space between words is 7 units
### Examples:
- A = .-
- B = -…
- C = -.-.
- 1 = .----
- 2 = ..---

Some punctuation also has 9 code representations:
- Period (.) = .-.-.-
- Comma (,) = --..—

## Examples of Words in Morse Code
Here are a few examples of English words translated into Morse code:
- **HELLO** = `…. . .-.. .-.. ---`
- **WORLD** = `.-- --- .-. .-.. -..`
- **MORSE** = `-- --- .-. … .`
- **CODE** = `-.-. --- -.. .`
- **SOS** = `… --- …` *(used as a distress signal)*
